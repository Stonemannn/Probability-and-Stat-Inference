	<p>Hi, everyone! My name is Jiayu Shi. I come from Shanghai, China, and this is my first time to study in the USA. My undergraduate major is Applied Mathematics.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>After studying in mathematics for four years, I think I have already learned enough mathematics theories. But to solve real world problems, I realize that programming ability is what I need most now. So I choose the DS program in Vanderbilt University. And I believe this DS program will help me a lot.</p>
